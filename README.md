# Programming Foundations ‚Äì Learning Journey

This repository contains my complete set of practice codes, solutions, and mini-projects developed while following **Dr. Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud‚Äôs Programming Foundations Roadmap**.  
It documents my step-by-step learning process, from basic programming concepts to advanced topics in C++, C#, databases, and full-stack development.
